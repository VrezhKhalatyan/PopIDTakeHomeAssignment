Running TakeHomeAssignment.py Python Script from the Terminal or Command Prompt

Introduction:
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to execute a simple Python script using the terminal (Linux/macOS) or command prompt (Windows). Running Python scripts from the command line is a fundamental skill for developers and users working with Python.

Prerequisites:
- Python must be installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Ensure that the Python installation directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

Steps:

1. Open the Terminal or Command Prompt:
   - Linux/macOS: Open the Terminal. You can find it in the Applications folder or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
   - Windows: Open the Command Prompt. Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.

2. Navigate to the Script's Directory:
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example, if your script is located on the desktop, you can use the following command:
   
   cd Desktop
   

3. Run the Python Script:
   To run a Python script, use the `python` command followed by the script's filename. For  example, if your script is named `myscript.py`, use the following command:
   
   python TakeHomeAssignment.py
   
   If you're using Python 3, you might need to use the `python3` command instead of `python`:
   
   python3 TakeHomeAssignment.py
   

4. View the Script's Output:
   After running the script, the terminal/command prompt will display the output generated by the script. Depending on your script, this output could be text, numbers, or other relevant information.

5. Exiting the Script:
   Once the script finishes executing, it will return you to the command prompt. If your script contains an input prompt or a graphical interface that requires user interaction, the script might not return to the prompt until you close the interface.

6. Troubleshooting:
   - Module Not Found Error: If your script depends on external modules, ensure that you have them installed. You can use the `pip` command to install missing modules.
   - Syntax Errors: If you encounter syntax errors, review the code around the indicated line number for typos or incorrect syntax.

7. Additional Options:
   - Running Python in Interactive Mode: You can run the Python interpreter in interactive mode by typing `python` or `python3` in the terminal. This allows you to execute Python statements line by line.
   - Using Virtual Environments: For larger projects, consider using virtual environments to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the `venv` module.
